**The content of the Sphinx document can be written in Markdown or reStructuredText, except for the index page, which MUST be written in *reStructuredText*.**

## Guide to contribute to the documentation

**Your commit messages should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines**.

### Install the requirements

``` bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build the documentation (convert Sphinx rst/md to html)

(This step is only for preview the edited files)

``` bash
make clean
make html
```

The documentation will be generated in `build/html` directory in `en_US (English (US)).

If you need to change the language of the generated documentation, you can modify the `en_US` of `language = os.environ.get('READTHEDOCS_LANGUAGE', 'en_US')` of line 58 of `source/conf.py` file to your designated language.

### Update the translation files

(This step uses Simplified Chinese as an example, if you need to use other languages, replace `zh_CN` with your designated language)

``` bash
sphinx-build -b gettext ./source ./source/_locale -D language=en_US # You need to use the original language of the documentation here
sphinx-intl update -p ./source/_locale -l zh_CN
```

Then check che changed `.po` files in `docs/source/_locale/zh_CN/`. Update the `"Last-Translator:` information at the top of the file. Change it to `YOUR NAME <YOUR EMAIL>`, and then, for the changes:

- Empty translations will be generated for new texts
- `#, fuzzy` comments will be added to the translation for changed texts. Fix the translation and remove the `#, fuzzy` comment
- Translations for removed texts will be moved to the bottom of the `.po` file and be commented out
- Those msgid starts with `Bases: ` for base class displaying in auto-gen classes don't need to be translated

## Auto build server

```bash
sphinx-autobuild ./source ./build/html
```

Add `-D language=zh_CN` to the end if you want to autobuild a Chinese version of the doc
